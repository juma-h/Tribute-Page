            <h2><strong>Lifetime and Achievements:</strong></h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Born 10th February 1883.</li>
                <li>Orphaned at 12 years old.</li>
                <li>Studied MATH and Astronomy at Vassal College at 18.</li>
                <li>Became a Computer(performing calculations) for AT&T</li>
                <li>Clarke left AT&T in 1918 to study electrical engineering at MIT in Boston. She earned her master's degree in 1919.
                    <br>The first electrical engineering degree ever awarded to a woman at that institution</li>
                <li>Clarke went to work for General Electric as a supervisor of computers in the Turbine Engineering Department.
                    <br>During this time, she invented the Clarke calculator. Patented in 1921.</li>
                <li> On February 8, 1926, as the first woman to deliver a paper at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers' (AIEE) annual meeting.
                    <br>She showed the use of hyperbolic functions for calculating the maximum power that a line could carry without instability.
                </li>
                <li>Two of her later papers won awards from the AIEE: the Best Regional Paper Prize in 1932 and the Best National Paper Prize in <strong>1941</strong> </li>
                <li>She also worked on the design and building of hydroelectric dams in the West Hoover Dam, contributing her electrical expertise to develop and install the turbines that generate hydropower there to this day</li>
                <li>In 1943, Clarke wrote an influential textbook in the field of power engineering, Circuit Analysis of A-C Power Systems.
                    <br>This textbook was used as the basis of education for electrical engineers for many years</li>
                <li>In 1947, she joined the faculty of the Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Texas at Austin, making her the first female professor of electrical engineering in the country.She taught for 10 years and retired in 1957.
                </li>
